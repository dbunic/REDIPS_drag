- redips_rowspan is defined inside init_tables()
- optimization in set_trc() method
    1) search for rowspaned cells only if table contains rowspaned cells
    2) after cell is found, test if Y is inside current cell - this should prevent case where TD border > 1px and upper colspaned row like in example15
